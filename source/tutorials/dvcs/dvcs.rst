Distributed Version Control System Tutorial
-------------------------------------------

Installing SourceTree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes that you and other developers make to the code are stored in "code
repositories.""

Just like the web can be browsed with different web browsers, code repositories
can be browsed with different clients. We'll use a client called SourceTree.

Download SourceTree from:

http://www.sourcetreeapp.com

You can also follow along with the video tutorial below:

SourceTree is a nice GUI application that helps work with our repositories.
You can do a lot more by manually typing in commands on the command line,
but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

GitHub
^^^^^^

* Create accounts on GitHub
* One person, create a project. Include a 'readme'. Others can be left as default.
* Clone the project onto your computer.

Initial Project Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start with, one person on your team should have created your project on GitHub.
That person should have "cloned" a copy of the project on your computer.

For the person on your team that created your GitHub repository:

* Log into GitHub website.
* For the person that created the project, find it on GitHub.
* Click "Settings" tab
* Click "Collabrators"
* You'll likely have to re-enter your password
* Find your other team member(s) and add them as a collaborator. Also add my
  account 'pvcraven'.

For the other team members:

* Log into GitHub website.
* Find the project
* Clone your own copy of the project

Committing
^^^^^^^^^^

* Create the directory structure as shown in the assignment
* Add YOUR files, and your files only, to the project
* Commit those files
* Push them to the server

Merging
^^^^^^^

* If you push to the server, and someone else has already done so, your push
  will error out.
* Select "pull"
* Select "merge"
* Select "push"

How to resolve conflicts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We'll cover this in class

How to read the history
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
