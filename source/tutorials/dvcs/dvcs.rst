Installing SourceTree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes that you and other developers make to the code are stored in "code
repositories.""

Just like the web can be browsed with different web browsers, code repositories
can be browsed with different clients. We'll use a client called SourceTree.

Download SourceTree from:

http://www.sourcetreeapp.com

SourceTree is a nice GUI application that helps work with our repositories.
You can do a lot more by manually typing in commands on the command line,
but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
