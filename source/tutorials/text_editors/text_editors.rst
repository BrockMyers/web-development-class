Text Editors
============

CSE Validator
-------------

`CSE Validator`_ is one of my favorite tools. It makes it easy to validate
a web page. Or even an entire website. You hit a button, and it tells you all
your HTML and CSS errors. I have learned a great deal from this tool.

There are several versions of the software
ranging from free to about $350. I personally think the Pro version is worth
the cost. There is an `academic discount`_ if you are a student.

CSE Validator isn't quite as good at editing text as some other options. So
if I do much writing, I will usually open files in different program. Then
test the file later in CSE Validator.

Sublime
-------

This is my favorite text editor. You can try it out for free, but to get rid
of the nag-screens you need to pay money. The money is totally worth it.

The most expensive investment is to learn how to use Sublime well.
Sublime can be used
without spending time learning its features, but each feature can save time.

There are many tutorials out there. Here is one to get your started:

Atom
----

`Atom`_ is a text editor that is a lot like Sublime. It is slower, but it is free.

Notepad++
---------

A lot of people like Notepad++ as an editor:

Vim
---

If you want a real challenge, learn to use `Vim`_.

Notepad
-------

Windows comes with a built-in editor called Notepad. It is terrible. But
it comes with Windows, so I guess it has that going for it.

Microsoft Word
--------------

No, don't use this for web work. Don't even copy/paste back and forth from
Word. MS Word is bad for the web.
