Assignment 6 - AWS Deployment
=============================

Deploy your project onto your own server.

Follow the AWS tutorial.

Turn in:

* A link to your web site. It should be on an AWS server and probably starts
  with ``http://ec2-``
* A link to the GitHub project on the web. (A link to the web page,
  not a link to clone it.) Make sure it is a link to YOUR GitHub, not
  someone else's.
