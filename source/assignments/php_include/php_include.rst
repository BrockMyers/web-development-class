Assignment 7 - PHP Include
==========================

Take the project you have on your own web server, and modify it to use the PHP
include statement.

1. Put the navigation in a common file. Reference the navigation file from all the
   main pages that need it.
2. Put the footer in a common file. Reference the footer file from all the
   main pages that need it.
3. Use CSE Validator to check your entire website. Do *not* check your individual
   files as they exist on the disk. Check your actual web site.

Turn in:

* A link to your web site
* A link to the GitHub project
