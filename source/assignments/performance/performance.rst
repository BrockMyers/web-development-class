Assignment 8 - DNS and Performance
==================================

Part 1
------

Summarize what the DNS is, how to register a domain, and how a domain name
is resolved.

I'll go over this in class, so if you take good notes, you'll have part 1 done.

Part 2
------

Use `WebPageTest <https://www.webpagetest.org/>`_ on two different web pages.

* Your web site you created with AWS
* One other website that you found, which has performance issues. Do not pick
  a fast website like Google's search page.

Explain what WebPageTest shows, and also talk about how to improve the performance.

I'll do this in class with Hy-Vee. Your assignment is to do it with two more web
pages.
