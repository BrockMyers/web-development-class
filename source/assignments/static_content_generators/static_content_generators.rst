Assignment 11 - Static Content Generators
=========================================

This will be a group project. Grades will be individual.

First you should get together and meet.

* Choose a topic for the website. I'd suggest some kind of informational website.
  You can choose a business, a hobby, a historical event or place, etc. This
  will go on the web, at least temporarily, so I suggest making it fictional
  or about a subject that won't care if you make up information about it.
* Get approval of the topic from the professor.
* Map out the website and what will be on it.

Collaborate:

* Choose pages for each person to create.
* Assign pages in GitHub.
* Choose (different) pages for each person to review and proof-read.

Create web pages that have:

* Headings
* Images
* Tables
* Links
* Table of Contents
* Multiple types of styles

Turn in a the following links. Please clearly label each link
and follow the order below:

* Link to the GitHub project page.
  This should be the same for every person in the group.
* Link to each GitHub page that you created.
  Do not link pages that show someone else checking in this page.
  Clearly label which page shows you demonstrating the use headings, images,
  tables, and links.
* Link to the final website via S3
* Link to the final website via CloudFront

Important End of Term Reminder
==============================

After grades are posted for this class, remember to:

* Stop your EC2 web server. You can terminate it (make it go away) or just
  stop it.
* Remove your S3 bucket.
* Remove your CloudFront link.

This will help make sure that you don't get any unexpected fees charged to your
credit card.
