Assignment 9 - Install WordPress
================================

Using your AWS server, follow the :ref:`InstallWordpress`.

Name your site the same as the project you already have on AWS.

Turn in a URL of your working WordPress site.
It should look something like::

	http://myserver.com/wordpress/

It is not unusual to get a "Database Connection Error" if the installation
tutorial does not go your way. Make sure to schedule your work to allow time
to drop by and ask questions if you run into this issue.

Full credit if the assignment is turned in on time. Half credit if 24 hours
late. No credit for late assignments.
