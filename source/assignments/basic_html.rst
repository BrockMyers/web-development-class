Assignment 1 - Basic HTML
=========================

Project Overview
----------------

We will be working on building a website for a fictitious organization
throughout the semester. We will learn how to work on a website in groups.
This is the start of that website.

How to Work in Pairs
--------------------

A popular trend in programming is
`pair programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming>`_.
If done correctly, pair programming can:

* Improve code quality
* Improve job satisfaction
* Give programmers more opportunities to learn
* Build-in cross training so programmers can change jobs easier
* Build team dynamics

It is also possible to make pair programming a *bad* experience. Particularly
if the observer pulls out his or her phone. Therefore, if someone pulls
out their phone they will be asked to leave, and counted as absent.

I will assign the pairs. It is my plan to keep switching pairs, so you'll
get to work with several people in class.

When pair programming, you have a "driver" who is at the keyboard. You also
have a "navigator" or "observer." I like the work "navigator" better.
The "navigator" should be the one directing the coding. For example, if you
are driving, you have one person telling the driver to go left or right.
The driver worries about not hitting anyone.


Schedule
--------
* This is the first year we are doing web development as two semesters. I may
  need to fine-tune the schedule. Please listen for any schedule changes given
  in class.
* One person will "drive" and type on the computer for half the time.
  One person will direct. Each person should work to finish three pages. It is
  expected that some time will be spent outside of class to finish those pages.
  Do the hard parts first, and save the easy parts for outside of class.
* Thursday, spend about 15 minutes picking the topic, and figuring what pages
  you will build.
* Also on Thursday, split the rest of the time. One person navigates, one person
  drives. Switch places
* There may be ONE group of three. If you are in this group, please divide the time
  in thirds. Each person is still responsible for three pages.
* Tuesday we will cover how to turn in the assignment. See `Turning in a website`_.

If you are gone any of these days you will get half credit. If your phone is
out, or you are on an unrelated website, you'll be counted as gone and asked
to leave for the day.

Website Subject
---------------

Pick a subject out of this list. I am open to ideas that are not on the list,
but please see me first. The projects will be passed between groups, so keep
the subjects to ones that any student could work on.

* Selling BBQ sauce
* Local mountain bike club
* Local garden club
* Local business that teaches photography
* Local Italian restaurant
* Web page for a band that gets gigs, but isn't famous
* Website with recipes for families that want to eat healthy
* Cute/funny cat videos
* Information on the best mobile phone
* Local business that sells shoes
* Bed and breakfast
* DIY website
* Crafting website
* Info page for a fictitious city
* Page for a person running for state senate/congress/whatever
* Put your project idea up on the board. No duplicate project ideas.

All web pages must have text. Please create real, actual, content.
Text must be original and not copied.
Images should be original as well, with a few exceptions. If you want
an exception, please see me for information on how to cite and link it.

Required Components
-------------------

* Every page should have:

  * HTML comment at the top with the person who is primarily responsible for the
    page. This will be the page where you are the 'navigator.' The driver does
    the typing and will not be primarily responsible for that page.
    Each person should have at least three pages they are responsible for,
    and will be graded on.
  * Web site title and graphic. Put in its own <div>
  * Web site footer. Put in its own <div>
  * Unordered list of all pages in the web site, that link to the web pages. Links must be relative.

* Two Required pages

  * Main index page
  * About page

* Optional pages. Must have at least four.

  * News page
  * Items for sale page
  * Hours, directions
  * Page with video
  * Pages with info on a subject
  * Required placeholder pages. Just put in a title for now.
  * Login
  * Sign up, or some other 'enter information' page

* Required HTML elements

  * HEAD section on all pages
  * Table somewhere
  * Linked in images
  * HTML entities
  * Headings
  * Paragraphs
  * Tags must be lower case
  * Run a validation check on the HTML for each page. Make sure it is free of issues.
  * Check for spelling and grammar. It counts as part of the grade.

Turning in a website
--------------------

Assignment 2 will involve how to turn in Assignment 1. And a bit more than that. We will
be using a "Distributed Version Control System" (DVCS). So each person on the team
should keep all the files. When we start going over how to do this in class, then you'll
turn in the assignment.
