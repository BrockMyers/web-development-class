Assignment 3 - CSS
==================

In this assignment, each individual person will "style" one of the project websites.
Most projects will have two people independently styling the project.
To keep the work separate, everyone will have their own "branch" of the project.

Eventually, each website will have about four different branches with independently
created styles. We will select the best one hunger-games style.

To complete this project:

* Find the project that you have been assigned.
* Select a color scheme for your website

  * Use color theory and tools we talked about in class.

* Create a branch of the project in SourceTree.
* You may inherit a project with problems.
  Like bad links. Spend some time looking over the project and clean it up as needed.
* For index.html:

  * Apply one or more in-line styles
  * Apply one or more styles in the <head>

* For all pages:

  * Apply a stylesheet that you've created
  * Make sure the stylesheet is a subdirectory named "css"
  * Most of your styles should be in this page

* Create styles with a tag selector
* Create styles with an id selector (feel free to update HTML with ids and classes as needed)
* Create styles with a class selector
* Create borders
* Create a menu
* Find the table in the website and style it

* Common problems to avoid:

  * Blocks of text should black on white, or near-black and near-white.
    Maybe white on black. When reading text give your reader as much contrast as
    possible.
    Use color for highlights or titles.
  * Do not center blocks of text. That's very hard to read.

* Finally, spend some time doing detail work. Make it look good.
