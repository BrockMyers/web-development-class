Assignment 1 - Basic HTML
=========================

Project Overview
----------------

We will be working on building a website for a ficticious organization
throughout the semeter. We will learn how to work on a website in groups.
This is the start of that website.

How to Work in Pairs
--------------------

A popular trend in programming is
`pair programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming>`_.
If done correctly, pair programming can:

* Improve code quality
* Improve job satisfaction
* Give programmers more opportunities to learn
* Build-in cross training so programmers can change jobs easier
* Build team dynamics

It is also possible to make pair programming a *bad* experience. Particularly
if the observer pulls out his or her phone. Therefore, if someone pulls
out their phone they will be asked to leave, and counted as absent.

I will assign the pairs. It is my plan to keep switching pairs, so you'll
get to work with several people in class.

Schedule
--------
* One person will work on the computer Monday. One person will observe. You
  should work to finish three pages. It may require the person at the computer
  to work outside of class to finish those pages.
* Wednesday, switch spots. Finish the other three pages.
* There may be ONE group of three. If you are in this group, please divide the time
  in thirds. Each person is still responsible for three pages.
* Friday we will cover how to turn in the assignment. See `Turning in a website`_.

If you are gone any of these days you will get half credit. If your phone is
out, or you are on an unrelated website, you'll be counted as gone and asked
to leave for the day.

Website Subject
---------------

Pick a subject out of this list. I am open to ideas that are not on the list,
but please see me first. The projects will be passed between groups, so keep
the subjects to ones that any student could work on.

* Put your project idea up on the board. No duplicate project ideas.

All web pages must have text. Please create real, actual, content.
Text must be original and not copied.
Images should be original as well, with a few exceptions. If you want
an exception, please see me for information on how to cite and link it.

Required Components
-------------------

* Every page should have:

  * HTML comment at the top with the person who is primarily responsible for the page. Each person should
    have at least three pages they are responsible for, and will be graded on.
  * Web site title and graphic. Put in its own <div>
  * Web site footer. Put in its own <div>
  * Unordered list of all pages in the web site, that link to the web pages. Links must be relative.

  * Table somewhere
  * Linked in images
  * HTML entities
  * Headings

  * Run a validation check on the HTML for each page. Make sure it is free of issues.
  * Check for spelling and grammar. It counts as part of the grade.

Turning in a website
--------------------

Assignment 2 will involve how to turn in Assignment 1. And a bit more than that. We will
be using a "Distributed Version Control System" (DVCS). So each person on the team
should keep all the files. When we start going over how to do this in class, then you'll
turn in the assignment.
