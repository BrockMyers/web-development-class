Assignment 1 - Basic HTML
=========================

Project Overview
----------------

We will be working on building a website for a ficticious organization
throughout the semeter. We will learn how to work on a website in groups.
This is the start of that website.

For this assignment, work on the assignment in pairs. One person
works on the computer Monday, the other person on Wednesday. There may
be ONE group of three. If you are in this group, please divide the time
and pages up in thirds.

Friday we will cover how to turn in the assignment.

If you are gone any of these days you will get half credit. If your phone is
out, or you are on an unrelated website, you'll be counted as gone and asked
to leave for the day.

Turning in a website
--------------------

Assignment 2 will involve how to turn in Assignment 1. And a bit more than that. We will
be using a "Distributed Version Control System" (DVCS). So each person on the team
should keep all the files. When we start going over how to do this in class, then you'll
turn in the assignment.
