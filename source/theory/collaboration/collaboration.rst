`What qualities make for a good leader <https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/270486>`_?

How to keep people involved if they aren't the leader?

Methods to come to an agreement.
(`Article <http://springboard.resourcefulhr.com/leadership-styles-decision-making/>`_,
and `another <http://www.leadershipmanagement.com/html-files/decision.htm>`_ >)

  * Democratic (vote)
  * Consensus (get everyone to agree, slow)
  * Consultive (talk with everyone, smarter, still slow)
  * Autocratic (make a decision without asking, fast and stupid)
  * Delegation (pass the buck)

How to delegate work and follow up with work? We will use an issue tracker. See
(`creating an issue on GitHub <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/>`_)
