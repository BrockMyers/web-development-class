Static Content Generators
=========================

Static Content Generators - A Middle Ground
-------------------------------------------

So far we've talked about two ways of building websites:

* Coding them from scratch using HTML and CSS
* Using a Content Management System like WordPress

Coding a website from scratch makes it difficult to focus on the content,
rather than the code. It is also repetitive. A person can get tired of typing
``<p>`` all the time.

A CMS is a "heavy" solution. You've got a huge application written in PHP
with tons of plug-ins. The text editor makes weird HTML when you copy/paste
from MS Word. It is hard to deploy it across servers spread across the globe.
You have to worry about backing up a database. For many websites, WordPress
is overkill. Like commuting to work in a semi when you could just drive there
on a scooter.

Behold! There is a middle-ground. You can use a **static content generator**.
In fact, that is what I do for this website.

What is a Static Content Generator?
-----------------------------------

A static content generator uses simple plain-text source files to generate
a web-site's HTML and CSS for you. The generators usually use either the
**markdown** format or the **restructured text** format.

You might already be familiar with these formats. Web sites like Reddit
allow users to use markdown to format their posts.

Static Content Generators usually work the following way:

1. You edit text files in markdown format
2. You run the content generator
3. You now have HTML/CSS files you can upload to your server
